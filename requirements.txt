# Portal Still Alive Credits - Python Dependencies
# This project works with Python 3.6+ and uses native system audio players

# No external Python packages required for basic functionality
# The script uses native system audio players:
# - macOS: afplay (built-in)
# - Linux: mpg123, mpg321, or aplay
# - Windows: winsound (built-in) or system media player

# Optional: If you want to use playsound library instead of native players
# playsound>=1.2.2

# For development/testing (optional)
# pytest>=6.0.0
# black>=21.0.0
# flake8>=3.8.0
